# SQL-Mentor-User-Performance-Analysis-
 
Project Overview
This project is designed to help beginners understand SQL querying and performance analysis using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. In this project, you will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

Objectives

•	Learn how to use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
•	Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
•	Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, EXTRACT(), and DENSE_RANK().
Project Level: Beginner
This project is designed for beginners who are familiar with the basics of SQL and want to learn how to handle real-world data analysis problems. You'll be working with a small dataset and writing SQL queries to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.


SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset

The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:
•	User ID
•	Question ID
•	Points Earned
•	Submission Timestamp
•	Username
This data allows you to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.
